### Overview

This project creates 2 financial planning tools for the members of a fictitious credit union. The first tool will be used to visualize investments and assess wether or not a member has enough savings invested, in case of an emergency. The second tool will focus on retirement planning using a Monte Carlo simulation for future projections. The focus of this project is to utilize and become familiar with API's, Monte Carlo simulations, and the visualization of finances through charts.
